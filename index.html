        <h2>What is Masters Boxing?</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the USA Elite Masters Boxing website. Our goal is to put on
            USA Masters Boxing events that are streamlined, professional, and creating a

            pleasant competitive environment.

            So what is Masters Boxing? and who can compete in this division? Masters
            boxing is an amateur boxing division sanctioned by USA Boxing. To
            compete you must be 35 years of age or older, have never competed in any
            combat sport as a professional, and must be registered with an up to date
            USA Boxing Masters passbook and yearly physical. Those that are 45 years
            of age or older must also pass an exercise EKG also known as a stress test
            (the ekg is valid for 5 years). The process can sometimes be a challenge so
            we built this website to help guide you and hopefully answer any questions
            you might have. For a step by step guide on how to get your yellow USA

            Boxing Masters passbook, click on the link below.</p>
